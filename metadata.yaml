description: '"The facts contained in this volume are deeply interesting to the naturalist.
  They not only elucidate the history of those industrious animals whose properties
  are the peculiar subject of investigation, but they present some new and singular
  features in physiology, which have hitherto been unknown, and even unsuspected.
  The industry of bees has proved a fertile source of admiration in all countries,
  and in every age, and mankind have unremittingly endeavoured to render it subservient
  either to their gratifications or emolument. Hence, innumerable theories, experiments,
  and observations have ensued, and uncommon patience has been displayed in prosecuting
  the enquiry. But although many interesting peculiarities have been discovered, they
  are so unaccountably interwoven with errors, that no subject has given birth to
  more absurdities than investigations into the history of bees; and unfortunately
  those treatises which are the most easily attained, and at this day, the most popular,
  only serve to give them a wider range, and to render it infinitely more difficult
  for the philosophic naturalist to eradicate them. A considerable portion of the
  following work is devoted to this purpose; and it belongs to the reader to judge
  of the success which has resulted from the experiments that have been employed"--Préface.'
